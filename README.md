# Wearable-Computing-Tidy-Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Data website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
