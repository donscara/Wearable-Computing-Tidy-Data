# Wearable-Computing-Tidy-Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Data website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Files in the repository:

run_analysis.R
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
It creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

codebook.txt
This file contain the details of the variables used in this project

tidydata.csv
This file contain the the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
